# 👋 Hi, I'm Sangeet

I'm a researcher/engineer/developer (choose what fits you best) working primarily with **C++** and **Python**, focused on:

- ⚡️ **Parallel Programming** & **High Performance Computing (HPC)**
- 🌫️ **Computational Mechanics**: CFD, FEM, FSI
- ⚙️ Low-level optimization, numerical methods, and scientific computing

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Tools

- **Languages**: C++, Python, SQL, Bash
- **Parallelism**: OpenMP, CUDA
- **GUI**: PyQt6, PyQtGraph
- **Tools & Frameworks**: SU2, OpenFOAM, Calculix
- **Build Systems**: CMake, Make
- **Environments**: Linux, HPC clusters

## 📂 Projects & Interests

I'm passionate about solving real-world physics problems through scalable numerical simulations. Some areas I often explore:

- ➰ Splines (Bézier, Catmull-Rom, B-Splines)
- 🌀 Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI)
- 🧱 Finite Element Method (FEM)
- 🌊 Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
- 🧮 Numerical Linear Algebra
- 🔬 Profiling & performance tuning

> 💡 Always exploring new ways to make simulations faster, cleaner, and more reliable.
